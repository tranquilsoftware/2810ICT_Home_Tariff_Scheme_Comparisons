# PROPOSED FUNCTIONS
# compareTariffs(TariffData t1, TariffData t2) 
# calculateTariff(TariffData t) 
# validateDataFormat(TariffDataCell tdc) -- This is used in both functions above. 
# parseSpreadsheetData(Spreadsheet spreadsheetFile) 

# MARKING RUBRIC
# Implements four Python functions meeting all requirements: 
#  - at least one with parameters, one returning a value, and one using an ifâ€“else structure. 
#  - Functions are correct, clear, and well-structured. Each function contains at least 10 lines of code (excluding comments).

# UNIT TESTING, 
# Provides unit tests for all the four implemented functions, with both positive and negative test cases. 
# Tests thoroughly validate function behavior and edge cases. Achieves a 100% pass rate. 
# Test code is clear, systematic, and well-structured.


# COVERAGE TESTING, BRANCH COVERAGE TESTING.

# Provides comprehensive tests achieving 100% statement coverage and 100% branch coverage. 
# Test cases are clear, systematic, and well-documented. Results are verified with coverage reports.
